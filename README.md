<b><h1 style="text-align: center;">MovieBox</h1></b>

##MovieBox is an ongoing project aimed at creating a movie streaming website. Although it can't play movies at the moment, it serves as a platform to display movie details and images in a visually appealing way.

##Introduction
MovieBox is a web application designed to showcase movie details and images. While it's a work in progress, it currently offers the functionality to click on a movie card, which then displays the movie's picture and content on a second page. This is achieved by transferring the movie details in JSON format to the second page to replace the default content.
